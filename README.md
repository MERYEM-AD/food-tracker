### Project description:  

Web-based application that allows user to track calories on a daily basis. 

The goal of the application is to help user maintain a certain weight, lose weight, or gain weight depending on their goals. 

When the user joins the app, they will tell us their weight and also the weight they to maintain or achieve.

They will be able to add the calories of the food that they are consuming daily as well as look up recipes for what they would like to make.
